"""One function per tool, querying only the approved warehouse views.

The rule this module keeps: no arithmetic in Python. Every number a tool serves
is computed by the database from a view, so the definition of a metric lives in
one reviewable place - `migrations/0004_query_views.up.sql` - rather than being
half in SQL and half in a comprehension nobody reads.

Caller-supplied values are always bound, never interpolated. The only formatted
SQL fragments are fixed clauses selected by this module.
